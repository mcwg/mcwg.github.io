## PART I: Sample Syllabi

* [Part I: Sample Syllabi](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/tmanApplied7e/tmanApplied7ePart1.pdf)

Sample syllabi outlining various options are provided.

## PARTS II and III: Active Classroom Guide and Handouts

* [Part II: teacher guide](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/tmanApplied7e/tmanApplied7ePart2.pdf)
* [Part III: student handouts](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/tmanApplied7e/tmanApplied7ePart3.pdf)

The guide provides the tools for an active classroom. It includes chapter overviews, and for each section:

* A section overview.
* A description of the key points.
* A collection of in-class activities, including warm-up and wrap up activities, together with de- tailed teacher-only comments offering advice how to successfully implement them. 
* Descriptions of the textbook problems.
* A list of suggested homework problems.

## Part IV: Problem Sheets for Use in Class

* [Part IV: Classroom Problem Sheets](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/tmanApplied7e/tmanApplied7ePart4.pdf)

Two-page problem and summary sheets for every section of the text. These sheets include a list of key points and are populated with problems from the text. They are also available as pre-built WileyPLUS assignments. They can be used as stand-alone problems in class, or in conjunction with the Classroom Activities from the guide.

## Difference Between Parts III and IV
We are providing instructors with two sets of active-learning
handouts.  The problems and activities in both sets are designed to
ensure that if a student works through the problems for a given
section, then they will have mastered the learning objectives of that
section. Both sets of handouts provide students with the opportunity
to productively struggle with the concepts in class.   

The difference is:

* **Part III: Active-Learning Handouts:** Designed to allow students to access the content without the need of a
preliminary lecture.   Activities labeled as "possible motivating
activity" are often the introductory examples from the text,
converted to active-learning exploratory activities. Each activity is
accompanied by comments for the instructor indicating how the activity
moves the content forward.  Wrap-up activities are provided for
students to reflect on---and pull together---the concepts they learned
completing the activities and provide a quick way for the instructor
to asses student learning at the end the section.  

* **Part IV: Classroom Problem Sheets**:
These are designed to support active learning in a context where
content is first provided in a short lecture and may be easier to use
with large classes.

    The sheets have a summary of key ideas of the section, and students
can progress through the worksheet working individually, or in groups,
with less full-class discussion. 

    The problems are selected from the text carefully, so they do not overlap with suggested homework problems, but parallel them.  The problems are also in WileyPLUS.

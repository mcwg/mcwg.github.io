<div class="para">In <a href="formatExercisesFiles01.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.1: What is the correct format and naming convention for exercise files?">What is the correct format and naming convention for exercise files?Â 15.1</a>, a typical filename would be "1-2dslnp001.tex", which indicates that the exercise belongs in Chapter 1, Section 2, was written by David Lovelock (dsl), is a new problem (np), and is the first in this set.  However, this does not identify the book or edition. The recommended way is to use "1-2dsl<em class="alert">X</em>np001.tex" where "<em class="alert">X</em>" is replaced by the appropriate letters, depending on the book.</div>

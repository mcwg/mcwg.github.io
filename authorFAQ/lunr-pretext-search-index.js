To change it run chsh -s \/bin\/bash   (if the terminal complains that you don't have permission to do this, use sudo chsh -s \/bin\/bash instead, and provide your computer password when asked.)    Close the Terminal window and reopen it for all changes to have effect.

  "body": " Sometimes I'm asked to rewrite materials, and sometimes I'm asked to check them. What is the difference?  Rewriting means reorganizing or rewording the materials. Usually only one person is asked to rewrite something at a time.  Checking means checking that everything is factually correct. This includes checking that:    Each step is mathematically correct. (People do get the right answer and still make mistakes along the way.)    Each variable or quantity is defined unambiguously.    Each figure is correct and consistent with its location and description in the text, including labels and units. (This is particularly important if a figure from one section has been duplicated for use in another. Inappropriate remnants of its previous life may still remain.)    The solutions to exercises and problems    use the same notation and language as the text.    use a method that has been covered at that stage in the text.      All statements are correct, including not only statements about what is where in the rest of the book, but also whether it is in the book.    The situation described in a problem is accurate.    The CCHE Styles and Conventions are followed.    The words that a spell checker misses are used correctly. For example, \"Please bare with me\" and \"Please bear with me\" both pass a spell checker, but do not usually mean the same, even for us older folk!    In other words: Checking means check that whatever is said is correct. Checking means double check everything. However, checking does not involve reorganizing or rewording the manuscript.  Usually lots of people are asked to check the same materials simultaneously. It is almost impossible for one person to find all the mistakes, inconsistencies, and ambiguities.  "

Let's assume the exercise file is named \"1-2dslgnp3.tex\".   Figures    If you have a single figure in the Question, it is labelled \"1-2dslgnp3 fig \".    If you have several figures in the Question, they are labelled \"1-2dslgnp3 figa \", \"1-2dslgnp3 figb \", etc. (The \"a\", \"b\" have nothing to do with parts (a) and (b) of the Question - if there are any.)    If you have a single figure in the Answer, it is labelled \"1-2dslgnp3 ans \".    If you have several figures in the Answer, they are labelled \"1-2dslgnp3 ansa \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansb \", etc.    If you have several sets of several figures in the Answer, they are called \"1-2dslgnp3 ansa1 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansa2 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansb1 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansb2 \", etc.   Figures in the Short Answers inherit the labels used in the Answers.  Remember that the label used in a figure is the name of the TeX file that draws that figure.     Tables    If you have a single table in the Question, it is labelled \"1-2dslgnp3 tab \".    If you have several tables in the Question, they are labelled \"1-2dslgnp3 taba \", \"1-2dslgnp3 tabb \", etc.    If you have a single table in the Answer, it is labelled \"1-2dslgnp3 anstab \".

Let's assume the exercise file is named 1-2dslgnp3.tex .   Figures  Question statements:    If you have a single figure in the Question, it is labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 fig \".    If you have several figures in the Question, they are labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 figa \", \"1-2dslgnp3 figb \", etc. (The \"a\", \"b\" have nothing to do with parts (a) and (b) of the Question - if there are any.)    Answers:    If you have a single figure in the Answer, it is labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 ans \".    If you have several figures in the Answer, they are labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 ansa \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansb \", etc.    If you have several sets of several figures in the Answer, they are called \"1-2dslgnp3 ansa1 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansa2 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansb1 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 ansb2 \", etc.    Short answers:    Figures in the Short Answers inherit the labels used in the Answers.    Remember that the label used in a figure is the name of the TeX file that draws that figure.    Tables  Question statements:    If you have a single table in the Question, it is labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 tab \".    If you have several tables in the Question, they are labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 taba \", \"1-2dslgnp3 tabb \", etc.    Answers:    If you have a single table in the Answer, it is labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 anstab \".    If you have several tables in the Answer, they are labeled \"1-2dslgnp3 anstaba \", \"1-2dslgnp3 anstabb \", etc.    If you have several sets of several tables in the Answer, they are called \"1-2dslgnp3 anstaba1 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 anstaba2 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 anstabb1 \", \"1-2dslgnp3 anstabb2 \", etc.    Short answers:    Tables in the Short Answers do not have labels.

Case 1: The problem asks about a single set of figures that are similar to each other in purpose  For example:   Which of Figures (I)--(IV) is a parabola?  Match Figures (I)--(IV) to statements (a)--(d).  For each Figures (a)--(d). what critical points can you see?   Note that, in general, if the figures make up parts of a problem, the figures should be (a)--(d), so that the solution can have parts (a)--(d).  In Case 1, we give the figures upper-left-hand corner labels, which happens in the filenamefig.tex file in the line  \\begin{aspic}|1|[(a)](2,2)  the [(a)] puts \"(a)\" in the upper-left-hand corner. The figures should be input, so that they don't have a label (i.e. no \"Figure 2.4.\"). For example  \\begin{stayfig} \\valign[b]{ {\\input{figa}} {\\input{figb}}\/ {\\input{figc}} {\\input{figd}} } \\end{stayfig}    Case 2: There are two sets of figures that are cross-related  For example   Match the functions in Figure 2.4 to their derivatives in Figure 2.5.  Figure 5.1 shows a graph of f(x). Write possible equations for the graphs (a)--(d) in Figure 5.2.  Figure 6.8 shows a population of gnus. Figure 6.9 shows a population of penguins.   In these cases, you want it to be very clear that the graphs serve different functions. In this case you use  \\begin{stayfig} \\finput*{fig1} \\end{stayfig} \\begin{stayfig} \\finput*{fig2} \\end{stayfig}  and fig1.tex and fig2.tex contain the figures or the arrays of figures necessary. In sets, you continue to label them (a)--(d) or (I)--(IV) as in Case 1.   "

In all the mess that's in between these two commands you should be able to see where the table entries are: they are in lines like Time (hours) & 0 & 24 & 48 & 72\\\\ . The & 's separate entries and the \\\\ ends a row.  Another thing you will need to adjust is the row \\begin{calctabular}{c|c|c|c|c} . The first c is for the column containing the names of the variables or the function, and the remaining ones are for the entries in the table, so there should be as many of them as columns in the table (five in this case). Also, the c (center the column) could be replaced by l (left justify the column), or r (right justify the column).  This particular table has no caption, which is the general rule in exercises. However, tables in the text require captions. To create a table with a caption requires two changes:    Replace the line \\tinput*[table2] with \\tinput[table2] .    and replace the line \\end{calctabular}} with \\end{calctabular}}{The caption lives here} .    Here table2 can be whatever label you please, but it must be unique. (However, see What is the preferred convention for labelling figures and tables in Exercises? .) If you want to reference this table, you do so by something like Table~\\ref{table2} shows how to create a table in the book.   If you want to create a table with no table number (because it is not referenced, as happens in the short answers, and might happen in the exercises) delete the line \\tinput*[table2]   The first word in table headings should always start with a capital letter. Thus, \"Time\", \"Temperature\", and \"Percentage finished\" are correct.  For an example of a multi-row table, see How wide can I make a table?.   "

For example, we use cylinder, not right circular cylinder.    Wording. If you are struggling with the wording, look in one of the other books and find a problem that does a similar thing, and copy the wording, even if you don't like it. There are usually reasons for the way we word things.    QSETs. If the parts of a problem are repeated examples of the same sort of thing and are independent of each other ... for example, if you can imagine assigning just parts c and f ... then the problem should be broken up into a QSET. See In a collection of exercises, how do I give a subset of the exercises the same set of instructions, called a QSET? on how to construct a QSET, and When do I use a QSET? on when to use a QSET.    Figures. Please make a TeX file for your figure, with the \\figuremissing macro in it, and with instructions one how to make (commented out with percent signs). (Better still, use Eric's web site to draw the figure yourself.) Also use stayfig or fakefig (see Sometimes I want a figure with a number and a caption, sometimes with only a number, and sometimes with neither a number nor a caption. How do I do that? ) and don't comment that out (so we can clearly see where figures need to be made).    Tables. Please make them horizontal unless you have good reason to make them vertical. See How wide can I make a table? on how wide to make a table.    Hard spaces. Never use them outside mathematics. Don't use \\ or \\\\ or \\hspace or \\vspace or any other hard coded spaces. See May I use formatting commands (like \\vspace, \\hspace, \\smallskip, \\\\, etc.) in the text portion of my file? . Inside mathematics, if you find yourself using them a lot, there's usually a better way. For example, do  $$ z = \\mbox{ the sum of $x$ and $y$ } $$  instead of  $$ z = \\mbox{the sum of}\\ x\\ \\mbox{and}\\ y $$  Elliot recommends always putting spaces around the words in \\mbox and \\hbox , such as  $$ y= \\hbox{ Chocolate } = x. $$  Usually if you leave out the spaces around Chocolate, since math mode doesn't distinguish text from symbols, the C or e in chocolate might be far too close to the equal sign.    Labels. They go on examples, not their solutions. See How do I put an Example in a Chapter? on how to reference an Example.    References. Never put in hard references. Just do \\ref{} , with a note about where it should point. See May I reference an example, figure, or table, by hard coding the reference (e.g., \"Example 5\" instead of \"Example~\\ref{blahblah}\")? .    "

First do an SVN Update to make sure you have the latest files for Applied.    Navigate to Chapter 3 in Applied (BCHAP3). Create your NPs there, labelling them 3-1dslaqnp01.tex, 3-1dslaqnp02.tex, ..., 3-3dslaqnp01.tex, 3-3dslaqnp02.tex, ...    Create\/Edit the np-file in the BCHAP3 folder, that is tied to the section. In this case they would be ex-np3-1.tex and ex-np3-3.tex. For example, ex-np3-3.tex, may look something like this  \"\\begin{exgroup}[1] \\begin{qset}[ins3-3aq1-28] \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp01} \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp03} \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp04} \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp05} \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp06} \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp08} \\end{qset} \\begin{qset}[ins3-3dsl2] \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp02} \\qinput{3-3dslaqnp07} \\end{qset} \\qinput{3-4w70} \\qinput{3-4w71} \\qinput{3-miscw94} \\end{exgroup}\"  This contains the filenames of 8 nps created by dsl, and three from single.    Go to your folder in BUSNEWPROBS, BUSNEWPROBS\/Lovelock\/ and create another ex-np file for ALL the dsl NPs, called ex-npLovelock5.tex. This looks like ex-np3-3.tex, except it will also contain the filenames for Section 3.1, but will not contain the filenames from single.

On the other hand, if you want to replace Part (b) with \"NewBlah\" then edit the tex file to read:  \"Find the derivative of each of the following: (a) Blah (b) \\Bus{BlahBlah}{NewBlah} (c) BlahBlahBlah\"  Then email Elliot telling him what you have done.

This is probably because the meaning of the \\div macro has been changed in our macros for the multivariable book, as in \\div, \\grad, and \\curl . So you have to define another macro that accesses this symbol. You can do this by putting  \\mathchardef\\mydiv=\"3204  in the preamble of your file. Then the macro \\mydiv will give the division symbol. Of course, you can use any abbreviation you want instead of mydiv, as long as it's not already defined.  However, if you are using the Algebra macros, via \\asformt{ALGEBRA} , \\div produces the division symbol.  "

  "title": "What are some quick pointers on TeX?",
  "body": " What are some quick pointers on TeX?    Producing a typeset document using TeX is a three-stage process. You first create the original TeX file, the input file. Then you compile it (or TeX it) to produce a DVI file. Finally you look at the DVI file, either previewing it on screen or as a printed document. What you see on the screen should be the same as the printed version. Thus, you do not see the document in its final form while you are creating the original file.    The original TeX document is a plaintext file, with the extension \"tex\". A text editor (like WinEdt or Emacs) is used to create and save TeX files rather than a WYSIWIG word-processor program (like MS Word).    In TeX you type both the text and the commands that do the formatting in plaintext. At this stage you cannot see the effect of these formatting commands, and so, to an untrained eye, the plaintext may appear quite confusing.    Any formatting of the text that you do by hand in your text editor is ignored by TeX. For example, multiple spaces, tabs, and line breaks are all converted to a single space before typesetting. However, a blank line generates a new paragraph, whereas spaces at the beginning of a line are ignored. Never try to format a TeX document by using hard spaces.    Math mode is used to enter formulas. If the formula is to be on the same line as the text (called inline) then $E=mc^{2}$ is a famous equation. If the same formula is to be on its own line (called display math) then this would be formatted as $$E=mc^{2}$$ . (However, please see this .) The spacing of these is controlled completely by TeX. Adding spaces to either inline or display math, for example, $E = m c^{2}$ , has no impact.    There are some characters that TeX uses in special ways. For example, $ , which is used to enter inline math, and \\ , which is used as the start of a command. Another character that is useful is % , which is used at the start of a comment, and then the remainder of the line is ignored in the typesetting process.    When in math mode, math functions such as sin, log, etc., are usually entered by \\sin , \\log , etc.    There are four different types of dashes: - produces a hyphen (as in $y$-intercept ), $-$ produces a minus sign (as in $x-y$ ), -- produces an en-dash (as in 1990--2000), and --- produces an em-dash (the dash used for punctuation). None of these have spaces on either side.    Single quotation marks are produced by using the prime key (') and the backprime key (`). Double quotation marks are produced by using these characters twice ('' and ``). Never use the double quotation key to enter double quotations.    The command \\ldots generates ellipses (three dots on a line), whereas \\cdots generates three dots in the center of the line, aligned with a + or - sign. Thus, $a, \\ldots, c$ and $a + \\cdots + c$ would be the usual way of entering these formulas.    For some simple math formulas, see What do a few simple math formulas look like in TeX? .    "

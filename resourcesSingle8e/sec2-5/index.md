## Ideas for In-Class Activities
<!-- **Note:** All links here need github user access permissions (see above). -->

### From the [Teacher Manual](https://mcwg.github.io/tmanCombo8e/)
*  [pdf with ideas for the class](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/tmanCombo8e/tmanSec2-5.pdf)


### Worksheets
*  [The second derivative](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/Single8eWorksheets/sec-2-5-theSecondDerivative.pdf)
*  [Plotting functions with different properties](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/Single8eWorksheets/sec-2-5-derivatives.pdf)


## Concept Tests

Great way to quickly assess student understanding. Can be used with clickers.

*  [pdf with Concept Test Statements](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/SingleConceptTests8e/2-5-ConceptTests-Single8e-HughesHallet.pdf)
*  [pdf with solutions](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/SingleConceptTests8e/2-5-ConceptTests-Single8e-HughesHallet-sols.pdf)
*  PPT with Concept Test Statements
*  Beamer Slides with Concept Test Statements


## PPT for the Section

Very useful if you want to create your own pre-class videos. We recommend avoiding using these in class (better spend the class time doing some active-learning activities like suggested above, and working on concept tests).

<!-- Curated selection of problems from the section together with the section summary.
*  [Statements](bsec1-3act.pdf) for students.
*  [Solutions](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/AppliedResources7e/test3/bsec1-3actsols.pdf) need github user access permissions (see above).
*  [Desmos teacher interactive slides](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/6275400d6a2241368467fdf7)

*  Embedded online versions of these exercises (run by WeBWorK).

*  WileyPlus pre-made Homework with interactive online versions of these problems. -->

## Coreq Materials for the Section

### Quick quizzes
Quickly figure out if your students need some review before you get to this section.

If you find students need review, follow up with the corresponding coreq worksheet below.

*  [Identifying concavity](assesment1.md)
   

### Coreq Worksheets
With a short summary, a set of problems to work on (with or without solutions), and assessment wrap-up questions to review student learning. Can be assigned for individual work, or be used in parallel coreq sessions.

*  [Identifying concavity](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/coreqWorksheets/psec2-6coreq-sols.pdf) verbally, graphically, and numerically. Version without solutions also available [here](https://github.com/mcwg/DATA/blob/master/coreqWorksheets/psec2-6coreq.pdf).

### Skill Refresher Exercises

*  [Identifying increasing negative sequences of numbers](skillRefresh1.md)

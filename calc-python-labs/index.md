# Python, Data, and LLMs in the Calculus Classroom

February 2025

##  Calculus Python Notebook Labs

Pre-built Jupyter notebooks that allow students to further explore Calculus concepts with Python and real data.
<!-- Labs to help students further explore calculus with Python and integrate data science into the calculus course. They are interactive Jupyter notebooks that allow students experiment, explore concepts, and summarize results. -->
<!-- These labs use Python as an additional tool for integrating data science into calculus and further exploring calculus. They are a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks intended as a set of labs to accompany a calculus course. Each interactive Jupyter notebook is a "virtual laboratory" where students experiment and explore concepts from calculus and summarize their results.  -->

#### How to use them

(Requires a Google account)

*  Open one of the labs and press the `open in colab` button at the top. 
*  Once in Colab, you will be able to edit and run all the Python code.
*  Students should save their own copy (using the file menu) to be able to save their work and share it with their instructor.



## LLM + Colab labs

Labs in which students are instructed to prompt an LLM to produce code and then run it and tweak it in Colab.

##  Some interesting sample chatGPT conversations

They illustrate how Calculus-related conversations can look like when the LLM can run Python code by itself (no Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks involved).

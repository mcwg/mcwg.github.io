<p>NOTE: Possibly introduce the integral <span class="process-math">\(\int e^{x^2}dx\)</span> and have students try to find the antiderivative using the guess-and-check method. Show how the obvious guess <span class="process-math">\(e^{x^2}\)</span> does not work because of the extra term <span class="process-math">\(2x\)</span> that appears when we apply the chain rule. Then point out if the <span class="process-math">\(2x\)</span> from the chain rule had been under the integral sign in the first place, we could have easily done this integral. This gets the point across that integrands have to be in a special form to be integrated using substitution---a point you will need to come back to again and again.</p>

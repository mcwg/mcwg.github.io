# Precalculus AI labs

October 2025


These labs guide students in using an LLM to generate Python code related to PreCalculus concepts, which they then execute and modify in Google Colab. The idea is to get students to use AI to learn math, not just solve problems for them. Each lab focuses on a Precalculus concept in a context. 


## Sample labs by context
* ***Comparing Gas and EV car** usage costs using *linear functions* ([pdf](lab-linear.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-linear-export.docx)).
* **Modeling Football Kickoffs** using *quadratic functions* ([pdf](lab-quadratic.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-quadratic-export.docx)).
* **Analyzing movie releases per year** for various genres using *exponential functions* ([pdf](lab-exponential.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-exponential-export.docx)).
* **Thinking about Nascar and Formula 1** as a spectator to understand *periodic functions* ([pdf](lab-periodic.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-periodic-export.docx)).
* **Predicating city poplations** with Zipf's law using *power functions* ([pdf](lab-power.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-power-export.docx)).


## Sample labs by function family
*  **Linear functions** to compare costs of *gas and electric cars* ([pdf](lab-linear.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-linear-export.docx)).
*  **Quadratic functions** to model *football kickoffs* ([pdf](lab-quadratic.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-quadratic-export.docx))
*  **Exponential functions** to estimate *movie releases per year* for different genres ([pdf](lab-exponential.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-exponential-export.docx)).
*  **Power functions** to predict *city populations using Zipf's Law* ([pdf](lab-power.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-power-export.docx)).
*  **Periodic functions** to model the distance to a spectator of a *Nascar or Formula 1* car ([pdf](lab-periodic.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-periodic-export.docx)).


## Intro Lab (Lab-Zero)
This lab shows students an how to use AI and Google Colab so they can use them in other labs as they learn the math.
*  Lab zero (coming soon)


## More about the labs
The labs guide students through using AI to generate models in engaging real-world contexts,  so that they can focus on the math using the rule of 4: understanding the model graphically, numerically, algebraically, and verbally. Meanwhile, the students learn to communicate effectively with an LLM to harness its power including by generating Python code. The real contexts also teach the students about finding, verifying the source of, and using data with the help of an LLM.

The labs serve as a friendly introduction to working with AI, data, and programming as students learn math. Easy to use for students and instructors: no prior experience needed. Instructors can integrate them into a standard Precalculus or Calculus course as in-class activities (perhaps replacing a lecture) or homework. Being self-contained, they are also appropriate as add-ons to an existing course.

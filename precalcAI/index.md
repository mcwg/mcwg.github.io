# Precalculus AI labs

November 2025


A collection of hands-on labs that integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools into learning and teaching Precalculus concepts.


These labs guide students in using AI to generate Python code related to Precalculus concepts, which they then execute and modify in Google Colab. The idea is to get students to use AI to learn Math, not just solve problems for them. Each lab focuses on a Precalculus concept in a context. 


## Sample labs
* Linear functions
   -  **Comparing Gas and EV car** ownership costs ([pdf](lab-linear.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-linear-export.docx)).
* Quadratic functions
   -  **Modeling Football Kickoffs**  ([pdf](lab-quadratic.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-quadratic-export.docx)).
* Exponential functions
   -  **Analyzing movie releases per year** for various genres ([pdf](lab-exponential.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-exponential-export.docx)).
* Periodic functions
   -  **Thinking about Nascar and Formula 1** as a spectator ([pdf](lab-periodic.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-periodic-export.docx)).
* Power functions
   -  **Predicting city populations** with Zipf's law ([pdf](lab-power.pdf), or editable [Word format](lab-power-export.docx)).

## Intro Lab (Lab-Zero)
This lab shows students how to use AI and Google Colab so they can use them in other labs as they learn the math.
*  Lab zero (coming soon)


## More about the labs
The labs guide students through using AI to generate models in engaging real-world contexts,  so that they can focus on the math using the rule of 4: understanding the model graphically, numerically, algebraically, and verbally. Meanwhile, students learn to communicate effectively with an LLM to harness its power, including generating Python code. The real contexts also teach the students about finding, verifying the source of, and using data with the help of an LLM.

The labs serve as a friendly introduction to working with AI, data, and programming as students learn Math. Easy to use for students and instructors: no prior experience needed. Instructors can integrate them into a standard Precalculus or Calculus course as in-class activities (perhaps replacing a lecture) or homework. Being self-contained, they are also appropriate as add-ons to an existing course.

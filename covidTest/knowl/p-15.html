<p>The new features of \(N\) that we can see in the time graph is that its  graph is a bell shaped curve.  It is an even function, namely it is symmetric about the vertical axis.   You will now have a chance to explore which of the features of this graph came about because of our choice of parameter values, and which ones are always present when \(N\) is the derivative of a logistic curve.</p>

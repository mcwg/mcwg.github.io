<p>EAJ - Below are two alternate versions for the above problem.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>The first asks for mathematical expressions.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>It will mark as correct any student answers that add up to the derivative of the expression on the right as long as neither of them is zero (if we ask for expressions, we should accept any way that is correct!).</li>
<li>If it seems unfortunate to mark as correct answers that are not what we expect and want them to do, a way to fix it would be to add details for the instructions in which we say in words what we actually expect. These may look artificial, but we would verbalize what we actually expect!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second one is about matching. The distractors are the integrals of the expression (in case they decide to integrate with wolfram alpha), and about splitting as as sum or not.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>It helps direct them to what we are actually expecting them to do!</li>
<li>Several versions of these would need to be made (for each form). The good thing is that we could save some for the online assessment versions</li>
</ul>

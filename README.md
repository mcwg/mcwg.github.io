# Mathematics Consortium Working Group Website
The Consortium works to empower students from all backgrounds to master interesting and useful college-level mathematics. We are educators from a broad range of academic institutions and mathematical disciplines. The Consortium was formed in the late 1980s in response to calls to create more lively calculus courses.

We design materials that accommodate teaching in all environments, providing activity-based resources that add meaning and applicability to coursework. We combine conceptual learning with a large collection of contemporary real-world problems. We advocate the use of technology in support of student learning, allowing for what is most appropriate in particular settings. We pioneered the “Rule of Four” emphasizing the use of multiple representations (algebraic, numerical, graphical and verbal) to encourage versatility in approaches to problem solving.

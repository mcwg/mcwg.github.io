<p>We know that \(f(x,y)\) has a global maximum and minimum subject to the constraint because the constraint is closed and bounded. A global minimum or maximum of \(f\) subject to the constraint \(x^2+y^2\leq 1\) will either be a minimum or maximum on the boundary \(x^2+y^2=1\) and can therefore be found using Lagrange multipliers, or will occur at a critical point on the inside \(\newcommand{\lt}{\lt }x^2+y^2\lt 1\text{.}\) We already found the global minimum and maximum on the boundary in (a), so we just need to compare to the value at the critical points.</p>
<p>From (b), the only critical point is \((0,0)\text{,}\) which does occur inside the boundary. However, since \(f(0,0)={6}\) is not bigger than the global maximum on the boundary and not smaller than the global minimum on the boundary, the maximum and minimum values subject to the constraint \(x^2+y^2\le 1\) are the same as the ones subject to the constaint \(x^2+y^2=1\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-5.html#li-32">in-context</a></span>

<p>Since answers can be submitted multiple times, don't hesitate to try different strategies.   You can learn from your mistakes, but only if you reflect on what you might have done wrong and what you could do to improve your answer.  Similarly, you can learn from your peers if you think about their ideas.  If you and your peers cannot figure out a problem, others in the class likely cannot either, and at that point, presenting your strategy to your teacher or the whole class can help you and others.  Attacking the problems in this way should allow you to learn the most from the activity.</p>

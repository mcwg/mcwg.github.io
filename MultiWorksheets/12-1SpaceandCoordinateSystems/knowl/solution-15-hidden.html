<li><p>Since the variable \(r\) measures the distance of a point from the \(z\)-axis, any point that satisfies the equation \(r={3}\) lies a distance \({3}\) from the \(z\)-axis. Thus the graph of the equation \(r={3}\) is a cylinder of radius \({3}\) centered on the \(z\)-axis. This matches Figure C.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not immediately clear what this graph looks like, so we start by converting.  Since \(r^2=x^2+y^2\) this when converting to Cartesian coordinates, this equation becomes \(x^2+y^2+z^2={1}\) which is a sphere of radius \({1}\) centered at the origin. This matches Figure A.</p></li>
<li><p>If we fix the angle \(\theta=\pi /2\) in the \(xy\)-plane and allow \(r\) to vary, we obtain the \(y\)-axis with \(x\geq 0\text{.}\) Since \(z\) is also allowed to vary, this equation gives a vertical half-plane whose intersection with the \(xy\)-plane is the \(y\)-axis with \(x\geq 0\text{.}\) This matches Figure D.</p></li>
<li><p>First, if we fix the angle \(\theta=0\) we see that \(z=r\) is a half-line starting at the origin in the \(xz\)-plane at an angle \(\pi /4\) from the positive \(x\)-axis. Since there are no restrictions on \(\theta\) the graph of \(r=z\) is obtained by rotating this line around the \(z\)-axis. In particular, the graph of \(z=r\) is an upward-facing cone with vertex at the origin. Converting, we get \(z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) which is a Cartesian equation for a cone. This matches Figure B.</p></li>

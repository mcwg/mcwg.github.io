<li><p>First, since \({3}\leq r\leq {5}\text{,}\) this region occurs between the circles of radius \({3}\) and \({5}\) centered at the origin. Since there are no restrictions on \(\theta\text{,}\) it is the whole of the region between these circles. This matches Figure A.</p></li>
<li><p>First, since \({2}\leq r\leq {3}\text{,}\) this region occurs between the circles of radius \({2}\) and \({3}\) centered at the origin. Since \(\pi /4\leq \theta \leq 3\pi /4\text{,}\) this means it is the region between these two circles with \(y\geq 0\) between the lines \(y=x\) and \(y=-x\text{.}\) This matches Figure C.</p></li>
<li><p>First, since \(0\leq r\leq {3}\text{,}\) this region occurs inside the circle of radius \({3}\) centered at the origin. Since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi\text{,}\) this means \(y\geq 0\text{.}\) Thus this region is the upper half-circle of radius \({3}\) centered at the origin. This matches Figure D.</p></li>
<li><p>First, since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi /4\text{,}\) this region occurs in the triangle bounded by the positive \(x\)-axis and the line \(y=x\text{.}\) Next, since  \(0\leq r\leq {5}\text{,}\) this region occurs inside the circle of radius \({5}\text{.}\) Thus this region is one eighth of the circle of radius \({5}\) centered at the origin in the first quadrant below the line \(y=x\text{.}\) This matches Figure B.</p></li>

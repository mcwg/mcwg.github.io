<li><p>First, since \(0\leq r\leq {1}\text{,}\) this region occurs inside the cylinder of radius \({1}\) centered on the \(z\)-axis. Next, since \(0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi \text{,}\) this means that \(\theta\) takes on all possible angles. For the lower bound \(r\leq z\text{,}\) we consider the surface \(r=z\text{.}\) Observe that for the surface \(r=z\text{,}\) if we fix the angle \(\theta=0\text{,}\) we see that \(z=r\) is a half-line starting at the origin in the \(xz\)-plane at an angle \(\pi /4\) from the positive \(x\)-axis. Since there are no restrictions on \(\theta\text{,}\) the graph of \(r=z\) is obtained by rotating this line around the \(z\)-axis. In particular, the graph of \(z=r\) is an upward-facing cone with vertex at the origin. For the last bound, Since \(z\leq {2}\text{,}\) the region will be bounded above by the horizontal plane \(z={2}\text{.}\) Putting this all together, since the radius is never bigger than \({1}\text{,}\) we get a solid region whose bottom half \(z\leq {1}\)  is inside a cone and whose top half \(1\leq z\leq {2}\) is inside a cylinder. This matches Figure B.</p></li>
<li><p>First, since \({2}\leq r\leq {3} \text{,}\) this region occurs inside the cylinder of radius  \({3}\) centered on the \(z\)-axis but outside of the cylinder of radius \({2}\) centered on the \(z\)-axis. Next, since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi /4 \text{,}\) this region must occur in the lower half of the first \(xy\)-quadrant below the line \(y=x \text{.}\) Finally, since \(0\leq z\leq {3} \text{,}\) the height of the region is bounded below by the plane \(z=0\) and above by the plane \(z={3} \text{.}\) In particular, this is an eighth of a cylindrical shell of inner radius \({2} \text{,}\) outer radius \({3}\) and height \({3}\) centered on the \(z\)-axis.  This matches Figure C.</p></li>
<li><p>The bounds \(0\leq r\leq {3}\) in the \(xy\)-plane are all points in the circle of radius \({3}\) centered at the origin. Next, since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi /2 \text{,}\) this region must occur in the first \(xy\)-quadrant. Finally, since \(0 \leq z\leq {2} \text{,}\) the height of the region is bounded below by the plane \(z=0\) and above by the plane \(z={2} \text{.}\) In particular, this is a quarter of a cylinder of radius \({3}\) and height \({2}\) centered on the \(z\)-axis. This matches Figure D.</p></li>

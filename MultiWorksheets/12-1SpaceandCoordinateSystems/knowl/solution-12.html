<li>First, since \(\leq r\leq \text{,}\) this region occurs between the circles of radius \(\) and \(\) centered at the origin. Since there are no restrictions on \(\theta\text{,}\) it is the whole of the region between these circles. This matches Figure A.</li>
<li>First, since \(\leq r\leq \text{,}\) this region occurs between the circles of radius \(\) and \(\) centered at the origin. Since \(\pi /4\leq \theta \leq 3\pi /4\text{,}\) this means it is the region between these two circles with \(y\geq 0\) between the lines \(y=x\) and \(y=-x\text{.}\) This matches Figure C.</li>
<li>First, since \(0\leq r\leq \text{,}\) this region occurs inside the circle of radius \(\) centered at the origin. Since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi\text{,}\) this means \(y\geq 0\text{.}\) Thus this region is the upper half-circle of radius \(\) centered at the origin. This matches Figure D.</li>
<li>First, since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi /4\text{,}\) this region occurs in the triangle bounded by the positive \(x\)-axis and the line \(y=x\text{.}\) Next, since  \(0\leq r\leq \text{,}\) this region occurs inside the circle of radius \(\text{.}\) Thus this region is one eighth of the circle of radius \(\) centered at the origin in the first quadrant below the line \(y=x\text{.}\) This matches Figure B.</li>

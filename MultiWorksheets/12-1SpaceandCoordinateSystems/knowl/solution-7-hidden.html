<p>In order to sketch a solid region, it is first easiest to sketch the graphs bounding it.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>For \(x=0\) and \(x=\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(yz\)-plane, for \(y=0\) and \(y=\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(xz\)-plane, and for \(z=0\) we get a horizontal plane. The last graph \(z=x+y\) is a slanted plane whose \(z\) -values increase as \(x\) and \(y\) increase. It follows that the solid region \(0\leq x\leq \text{,}\) \(0\leq y\leq \text{,}\) \(0\leq z\leq x+y\) is in the shape of a box with a slanted lid and all other sides parallel to the three coordinate planes. This matches Figure B.</li>

This matches Figure C.</li>
<li>For \(x=0\) and \(x=\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(yz\)-plane, for \(y=-\) and \(y=\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(xz\)-plane, and for \(z=\) and \(z=\text{,}\) we get two horizontal planes. It follows that the solid region \(0\leq x\leq \text{,}\) \(-\leq y\leq \text{,}\) \(\leq z\leq \) is in the shape of a box with sides parallel to the three coordinate planes.   This matches Figure A.</li>

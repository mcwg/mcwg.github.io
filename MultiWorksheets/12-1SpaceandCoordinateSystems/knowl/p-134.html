<li><p>For \(x=0\) and \(x={1}\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(yz\)-plane, for \(y=0\) and \(y={1}\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(xz\)-plane, and for \(z=0\) we get a horizontal plane. The last graph \(z=x+y\) is a slanted plane whose \(z\) -values increase as \(x\) and \(y\) increase. It follows that the solid region \(0\leq x\leq {1}\text{,}\) \(0\leq y\leq {1}\text{,}\) \(0\leq z\leq x+y\) is in the shape of a box with a slanted lid and all other sides parallel to the three coordinate planes. This matches Figure B.</p></li>

<li><p>For \(x=0\) and \(x={3}\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(yz\)-plane, for \(y=-{2}\) and \(y={2}\text{,}\) we get two vertical planes parallel to the \(xz\)-plane, and for \(z={3}\) and \(z={4}\text{,}\) we get two horizontal planes. It follows that the solid region \(0\leq x\leq {3}\text{,}\) \(-{2}\leq y\leq {2}\text{,}\) \({3}\leq z\leq {4}\) is in the shape of a box with sides parallel to the three coordinate planes.   This matches Figure A.</p></li>

<li>
<p>For a point \(P\) to have a coordinate \(\phi =\pi /4\text{,}\) the line connecting the point to the origin has to make an angle of \(\pi /4\) with the positive \(z\)-axis. Thus the surface \(\phi =\pi /4\) is the set of all points which share this property, which is geometrically an upward-facing cone with vertex at the origin. Converting, since \(z=\rho \cos (\phi)\text{,}\) and \(\rho =\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\text{,}\) and \(\phi =\pi /4\text{,}\) we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
z=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Squaring both sides we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
z^2=\frac{2x^2+2y^2+2z^2}{4}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which simplifies to</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
z^2=x^2+y^2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since \(\phi =\pi /4\text{,}\) we must have \(z\geq 0\text{,}\) so we get \(z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) which is a Cartesian equation for a cone.  This matches Figure B.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a point \(P\) to have a coordinate \(\theta =\pi /2\text{,}\) the projection of that point into the \(xy\)-plane has to lie on the \(y\)-axis with \(x\geq 0\text{.}\) Thus the surface \(\theta =\pi /2\) is the set of all points which share this property, which is geometrically a half-plane. This matches Figure C.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the only restriction given is \(\rho ={1}\text{,}\) this is the set of all points a distance of \({1}\) from the origin. Geometrically, this is a sphere of radius \({1}\) centered at the origin. Converting to Cartesian coordinates, this equation becomes \(x^2+y^2+z^2={1}\text{,}\) which, as already noted, is a sphere of radius \({1}\) centered at the origin.  This matches Figure A.</p></li>

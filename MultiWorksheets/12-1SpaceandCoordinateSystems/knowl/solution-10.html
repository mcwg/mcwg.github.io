<li>We can start by converting to Cartesian coordinates. We know \(r\sin{(\theta )}=y\) and \(r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) so converting, we get \(y=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\text{.}\) This is equivalent to \(y^2=x^2+y^2\) or \(x^2=0\text{.}\) Thus we get \(x=0\) which is the \(y\)-axis. Note however that since \(y= \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) we can only have \(y\geq 0\) so this is the non-negative part of the \(y\)-axis.   This matches Figure D.</li>
<li>Since we are fixing \(r=3\) and allowing \(\theta\) to vary, this graph is a circle of radius \(3\) centered at the origin. Since \(r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\text{,}\) converting to Cartesian coordinates, we get \(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=3 \text{,}\) or \(x^2+y^2=9 \text{,}\) confirming that this is indeed a circle centered at the origin of radius \(3 \text{.}\) This matches Figure A.</li>
<li>Since we are fixing \(\theta =\pi /4\) and allowing \(r\geq 0\) to vary, this graph is half of the line \(y=x\) (which makes an angle \(\pi /4\) with the \(x\) -axis) starting at the origin in the first quadrant. Since \(\theta =\pi /4\text{,}\) we have \(\tan (\theta )=y/x\text{,}\) using the fact that \(\theta =\pi /4\text{,}\) we can convert to Cartesian coordinates as  \(\tan (\pi /4 )=1=y/x\text{,}\) and so \(y=x\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Since \(r\cos{(\theta )}=x\text{,}\) we simply have \(x=\) which is a vertical line. This matches Figure C.</li>

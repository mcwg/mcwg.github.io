<li>First, since \(0\leq \rho\leq \text{,}\) this region occurs inside the sphere of radius \(\) centered at the origin. Next, the surface \(\phi =\pi /4\) is a cone centered on the \(z\)-axis, so the bounds \(0\leq \phi \leq \pi/4\) restrict to all points above the cone. Putting this all together, since there are no restrictions on \(\theta\text{,}\) we get a solid cone topped by the solid sphere of radius \(\) centered at the origin. This matches Figure D.</li>
<li>First, since \(0\leq \rho\leq \text{,}\) this region occurs inside the sphere of radius \(\) centered at the origin. Next, since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi /2\text{,}\) this region must occur in the first \(xy\)-quadrant. Finally, since \(0\leq \phi \leq \pi /2\text{,}\) the region must have \(z\geq 0\text{.}\) In particular, this is the part of the solid sphere of radius \(\) centered at the origin that occurs in the first octant (when \(x,y,z\geq 0\)). This matches Figure A.</li>
<li>First, since \(\leq \rho \leq \text{,}\) this region occurs between the spheres of radius \(\) and \(\text{,}\) both centered at the origin.  Next, since \(0\leq \theta \leq \pi /2\text{,}\) this region must occur in the first \(xy\)-quadrant. Finally, since \(0\leq \phi \leq \pi /2\text{,}\) the region must have \(z\geq 0\text{.}\) In particular, this is the part of the solid region between the spheres of radius \(\) and \(\) centered at the origin that occurs in the first octant (when \(x,y,z\geq 0\)). This matches Figure B.</li>

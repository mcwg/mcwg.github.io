<li>The graph of \(z=y\) in the \(2\)-dimensional \(yz\)-plane is a line. The corresponding graph in \(3\)-space is the line extended outward in the positive and negative \(x\)-directions since there are no requirements on \(x\text{.}\) In particular it is a slanted plane. This matches Figure D.</li>
<li>The graph of \(y=\sqrt{x}\) in the \(2\)-dimensional plane is the standard square root function. The corresponding graph in \(3\)-space is the square root graph extended vertically up and down since there are no requirements on \(z\text{.}\)  This matches Figure B.</li>
<li>Since \(z=\) and there are no requirements on \(x\) and \(y\text{,}\) this gives all points whose \(z\)-coordinate is equal to \(\) which is a horizontal plane.  This matches Figure A.</li>
<li>The graph of \(x^2+y^2=1\) in the \(2\)-d plane is the unit circle. The corresponding graph in \(3\)-space is the unit circle extended vertically up and down since there are no requirements on \(z\text{.}\) In particular is a vertical cylinder.  This matches Figure C.</li>

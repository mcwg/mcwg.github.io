<span class="type">Item</span> <span class="codenumber">5.4.2</span>.</h6>First, since \(0\leq r\leq \text{,}\) this region occurs inside the cylinder of radius \(\) centered on the \(z \)-axis. Next, since \(0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi \text{,}\) this means that \(\theta\) takes on all possible angles. For the lower bound \(r\leq z\text{,}\) we consider the surface \(r=z\text{.}\) Observe that for the surface \(r=z\text{,}\) if we fix the angle \(\theta=0\text{,}\) we see that \(z=r\) is a half-line starting at the origin in the \(xz\)-plane at an angle \(\pi /4\) from the positive \(x\)-axis. Since there are no restrictions on \(\theta\text{,}\) the graph of \(r=z\) is obtained by rotating this line around the \(z\)-axis. In particular, the graph of \(z=r\) is an upward-facing cone with vertex at the origin. For the last bound, Since \(z\leq \text{,}\) the region will be bounded above by the horizontal plane \(z=\text{.}\) Putting this all together, since the radius is never bigger than \(\text{,}\) we get a solid region whose bottom half \(z\leq \)  is inside a cone and whose top half \(1\leq z\leq \) is inside a cylinder. This matches Figure B.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-5.html#li-233">in-context</a></span>

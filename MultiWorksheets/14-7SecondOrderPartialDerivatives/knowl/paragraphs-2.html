<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Second-order derivatives measure concavity, or how slope changes. Specifically:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p>\(f_{xx}\text{:}\) positive if the slope \(f_x\) is increasing as we move in the \(x\)-direction; negative if the slope \(f_x\)  is decreasing as we move in the \(x\)-direction.</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_{yy}\text{:}\) positive if the slope \(f_y\) is increasing as we move in the \(y\)-direction; negative if the slope \(f_y\) is decreasing as we move in the \(y\)-direction.</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_{xy}\text{:}\) positive if the slope \(f_x\) in the \(x\)-direction is increasing as we move in the \(y\)-direction; negative if the slope \(f_x\)  in the \(x\)-direction  is decreasing as we move in the \(y\)-direction.</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_{yx}\text{:}\) positive if the slope \(f_y\) in the \(y\)-direction is increasing as we move in the \(x\)-direction; negative if the slope \(f_y\)  in the \(y\)-direction  is decreasing as we move in the \(x\)-direction.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The sign of a second derivative at a point can be determined from a contour diagram if you know the signs of \(f_x\) and \(f_y\) and how the spacing of contours are changing.</p></li>

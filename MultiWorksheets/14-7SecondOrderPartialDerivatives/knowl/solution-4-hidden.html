<p>We consider each derivative individually:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>\(f_{x}(-1,1)\) is negative since the contour values go down from \(1\) at \((-1,1)\) toward 0 as \(x\) increases.</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_{y}(-1,1)\) is negative since the contour values go down from \(1\) at \((-1,1)\) toward 0 as \(y\) increases.</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_{xx}(-1,1)\) is positive since \(f_x\) is negative and the contours are getting further apart in the \(x\)-direction (so the slope is getting “less negative”).</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_{yy}(-1,1)\) is negative since \(f_y\) is negative and the contours are getting closer together  in the \(y\)-direction (so the slope is getting “more negative”).</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_{xy}(-1,1)\) is negative since \(f_x\) is negative and the contours in the \(x\)-direction get closer together as we move in the \(y\)-direction (so the  slope is getting “more negative”).</p></li>

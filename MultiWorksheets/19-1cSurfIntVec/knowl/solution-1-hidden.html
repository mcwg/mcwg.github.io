<p>First we note that the vector field \(\vec{F}=x\vec{i} +y\vec{j} +z\vec{k}\) is the radial vector fieldâ€”the vectors all point radially away from the origin getting bigger as we move further from the origin.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since all vectors in \(\vec{F}\) point in the same direction as the orientation of \(S\) (outward), this integral is positive.</p></li>
<li><p>Since all vectors in \(\vec{F}\) point in the opposite direction as the orientation of \(S\) (upward versus downward on the surface), this integral is negative.</p></li>
<li><p>The surface \(S\) is a sphere of radius \(1\) centered at \((1,1,1)\text{.}\) Now, even though some of the vectors in \(\vec{F}\) flow into \(S\) against the orientation, those vectors are close to the origin are small in magnitude. The vectors that flow out of \(S\text{,}\) however, are further away from the origin so larger in magnitude. In particular, the net result is a positive integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Since all vectors in \(\vec{F}\) point along the cone, they are all perpendicular to the orientation, so this integral is zero.</p></li>

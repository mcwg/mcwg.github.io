<p>First we note that since \(S\) is the flat disk \(x^2+y^2\leq 1\) in the plane \(z=-{3}\) oriented upward, its orientation is the vector \(\vec{k}\text{.}\) In particular, only the \(\vec{k}\)-component of  vector field \(\vec{F}\) contributes to the flow through \(S\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since the \(\vec{k}\)-component \(z^2\) of \(\vec{F}\) is positive on the surface \(S\text{,}\)  the vector field \(\vec{F}\) flows with the orientation of \(S\text{,}\) and thus this integral is positive.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the \(\vec{k}\)-component \(-{5}x^2\) of \(\vec{F}\) is negative on the surface \(S\text{,}\)  the vector field \(\vec{F}\) flows against the orientation of \(S\text{,}\) and thus this integral is negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the \(\vec{k}\)-component \(-{7}z\) of \(\vec{F}\) is positive on the surface \(S\) (since \(z=-{3}\)), the vector field \(\vec{F}\) flows with the orientation of \(S\text{,}\) and thus this integral is positive.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the \(\vec{k}\)-component of \(\vec{F}\) is zero on the surface \(S\text{,}\)  the vector field \(\vec{F}\) does not flow through \(S\text{,}\) thus this integral is zero.</p></li>

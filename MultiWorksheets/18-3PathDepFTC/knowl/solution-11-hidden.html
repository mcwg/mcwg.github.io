<p>Based on the figure, it looks like \(\vec{F}\) curls around any point along the \(x\)-axis on a counterclockwise direction. Therefore, \(\vec{F}\) is definitely not conservative (we only needed to know the scalar curl was not zero at just one point).</p>
<p>Note that one can argue geometrically that the scalar curl is in fact non-zero at all points as follows: for points with \(y&gt;0\text{,}\) the vectors above the point are larger than the vectors below the point, so there is an induced counterclockwise rotation even though they point in the same direction! Same argument can be given for points with \(y\lt 0\text{.}\)</p>

<p>Since the component functions of \(\vec{F} =x^{3}e^{{2}x} \vec{i} +e^{\cos{y^{2}}} \vec{j}\) are defined everywhere, \(\vec{F}\) does not have any holes in its domain, so the curl test applies. The scalar curl of  \(\vec{F}\) is \(0-0=0\text{,}\) so \(\vec{F}\) is conservative. Finding a potential function looks like it could be very hard, but fortunately, since \(C\) is closed, its endpoints coincide. Therefore, by the  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{C} (x^{3}e^{{2}x} \vec{i} +e^{\cos{y^{2}}} \vec{j})\cdot d\vec{r} =0.
\end{equation*}

<p>Note that this solution method is much shorter that computing the integral along the four paths separately. Some of those integrals are very difficult to compute exactly.</p>

<p>A region \(U\) is simply connected if every simple closed curve completely contained in \(C\) can be shrunk to a point in \(U\) without breaking and without leaving \(U\text{.}\) For a region in \({\mathbb R}^2\text{,}\) this is equivalent to there being no holes contained within the region.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>This region is not simply connected as any loop around the middle circle could never be pulled to a point without leaving the region.</p></li>
<li><p>This region is simply connected as there are no holes.</p></li>
<li><p>This region is not simply connected as any loop around the hole in the center of the region could never be pulled to a point without leaving the region.</p></li>
<li><p>This region is simply connected since even though there is a hole on the edge of the region; this would not prevent a closed curve from being pulled to a point within the region since no closed curve could lie entirely within this region, and encircle this hole at the same time.</p></li>

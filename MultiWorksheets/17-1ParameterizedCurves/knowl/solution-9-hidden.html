<p>The correct answers are D, E, B, C, F, A. Explanations are below.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>For the equation \(\vec{r}(t) =t\vec{i} +t\vec{j} +t^3\vec{k}\) the \(\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{j}\) components parameterize a line, so the projection of this curve into the \(xy\)-plane is a line. The \(\vec{k}\) component gives the height of the curve \(C\) which increases at an increasing rate as \(t\) increases. It follows that \(\vec{r}(t) =t\vec{i} +t\vec{j} +t^3\vec{k}\) parameterizes a curve whose shadow is a line in the \(xy\)-plane and increases with a concave-up shape in the \(z\)-direction.</p></li>
<li><p>For the equation \(\vec{r}(t)=(1-4t)\vec{i} +(2-3t)\vec{j} +\sin{(t)} \vec{k}\) the \(\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{j}\) components parameterize a line, so the projection of this curve into the \(xy\)-plane is a line. The \(\vec{k}\) component gives the height of the curve \(C\) which oscillates since the component function is trigonometric. It follows that \(\vec{r}(t)=(1-4t)\vec{i} +(2-3t)\vec{j} +\sin{(t)} \vec{k}\) parameterizes a wave-like curve oscillating in the \(z\)-direction above a line in the \(xy\)-plane.</p></li>
<li><p>For the equation \(\vec{r}(t)=\vec{i} +\cos{(t)}\vec{j} +\sin{(t)}\vec{k}\) with \(0\leq t\leq 2\pi\text{,}\) the \(\vec{j}\) and \(\vec{k}\) components parameterize a circle centered at the origin in the \(yz\)-plane, so the projection of this curve into the \(yz\)-plane is a circle. Since the \(\vec{i}\) component is constant, the \(x\)-value of this curve never changes. It follows that  \(\vec{r}(t)=\vec{i} +\cos{(t)}\vec{j} +\sin{(t)}\vec{k}\) parameterizes a circle parallel to the \(yz\)-plane at \(x=1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>For the equation \(\vec{r}(t) =t\cos{(t)}\vec{i} +t\sin{(t)}\vec{j} +t\vec{k}\) we first consider the \(\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{j}\) components. The \(\cos{(t)}\) and \(\sin{(t)}\) in these components imply rotational motion and the multiple of \(t\) implies increased radius of rotation as \(t\) increases. It follows that the \(\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{j}\) components parameterize a spiral in the \(xy\)-plane spiraling out from the origin in a counterclockwise direction, so the projection of this curve into the \(xy\)-plane is this spiral. The \(\vec{k}\) component gives the height of the curve \(C\) which increases as \(t\) increases. It follows that \(\vec{r}(t) =t\cos{(t)}\vec{i} +t\sin{(t)}\vec{j} +t\vec{k}\) parameterizes a spiral around the \(z\)-axis, whose radius increases with height, similar to the shape of a tornado.</p></li>
<li><p>For the equation \(\vec{r}(t)=\cos{(t)}\vec{i} +\sin{(t)}\vec{j} +t\vec{k}\text{,}\) the \(\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{j}\) components parameterize a circle in the \(xy\)-plane centered at the origin, so the projection of this curve into the \(xy\)-plane is a circle. The \(\vec{k}\) component gives the height of the curve \(C\) which increases as \(t\) increases. It follows that \(\vec{r}(t)=\cos{(t)}\vec{i} +\sin{(t)}\vec{j} +t\vec{k}\) parameterizes a helix around the \(z\)-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>For the equation \(\vec{r}(t)=\vec{i} +\cos{(t)}\vec{j} +\sin{(t)}\vec{k}\) with \(0\leq t\leq \pi\text{,}\) the \(\vec{j}\) and \(\vec{k}\) components parameterize a half-circle (since \(0\leq t\leq \pi\)) centered at the origin in the \(yz\)-plane, so the projection of this curve into the \(yz\)-plane is a half-circle. Since the \(\vec{i}\) component is constant, the \(x\)-value of this curve never changes.  It follows that  \(\vec{r}(t)=\vec{i} +\cos{(t)}\vec{j} +\sin{(t)}\vec{k}\) parameterizes a half-circle parallel to the \(yz\)-plane at \(x=1\text{.}\)</p></li>

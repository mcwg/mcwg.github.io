<p>Suppose a curve \(C\) is parameterized by \(\vec{r}(t)\colon {\mathbb R} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n\text{:}\)</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p>\(C\) is said to be continuous if the component functions of \(\vec{r}(t)\) are all continuous. It is piecewise continuous if the domain can be broken up into subintervals over each of which \(\vec{r}(t)\) is continuous.</p></li>
<li><p>\(C\) is said to be differentiable if the component functions of \(\vec{r}(t)\) are all differentiable. It is piecewise differentiable if the domain can be broken up into subintervals over each of which \(\vec{r}(t)\) is differentiable.</p></li>
<li><p>\(C\) is said to be  \(C^1\)  if the component functions of \(\vec{r}(t)\) all have continuous partial derivatives. It is called piecewise \(C^1\) if the domain can be broken up into subintervals over each of which \(\vec{r}(t)\) is \(C^1\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, to test whether a curve is continuous, differentiable or \(C^1\text{,}\) we test whether the component functions of \(\vec{r}(t)\) exhibit this property.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-3.html#li-5">in-context</a></span>

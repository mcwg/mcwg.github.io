# Climate Change Resources from the Mathematics Consortium Working Group (MCWG)
This page has teaching resources related to the Climate Change for college-level Mathematics courses. 

These resources are copyrighted Â©*Mathematics Consortium Working Group, Hughes Hallett et al.* and are distributed freely to promote their use and collect feedback. Our ultimate goal is to create a collection of resources that will help students understand the relevance of mathematical ideas in college-level Mathematics courses in a context which is affecting their lives directly.

## Percentages and Proportions: Lake Mead

This activity has students find different ways to express how much water Lake Mead has and is missing right now. This involves converting between units and could involve using scientific notation. 

<!-- Idea is to understand that it is highly certain that a shortage of water will happen, but it is uncertain when it will happen. -->

*  [PPT slides](/files/LakeMead.pptx) for teachers with details about this activity.
*  [Sample problem statements and solutions](/files/LakeMeadProblems.docx) to use in class.
<!-- *  [Spreadsheet](/files/IcebreakTucson-21_Sols_Full.xls) with data and solutions. (students can be asked to get the data themselves from the [NOAA site](https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/climate/Tucson100s/Tucson100s_1st100.php)). -->

## Linear Decrease: Tucson Ice Break

This activity has students find a linear trend line for the data on the first day temperature goes over 100F at Tucson Airport each year.  

They will find that there is variability in the data which makes predictions uncertain, but date definitely  seems to be changing (about 1 day earlier each decade). They will also see that the vertical intercept of the trend line is meaningless (ice break in Tucson was definitely not in October-November in the year 0 AD).

## Linear Decrease: Japanese Cherry Blossoms

This activity has students find a linear trend line for the data on the full flowering date for cherry trees at Kyoto since 9th century. They will find that there is variability in the data which makes predictions uncertain, but date definitely  seems to be changing (about 4 days in 70 years).

## Exponential Functions: Sea Level rise and Lourdes Hospital Floodwall

This activity has students analyze the expenditure for the Lourdes Hospital floodwall. They need to convert all costs and benefits to present values (exponential decay) and then add them together to decide if floodwall is payed off. 

<!-- The graph shows the monthly mean CO_2 concentration data from Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, which has been collecting data related to climate change since the 1950s. -->

## Linear and Exponential Growth: Carbon Dioxide Mauna Loa Data

This activity has students attempt to fit linear and exponential models to the trend line in the CO2 data. They will find growth is *more* than exponential.

<p>If \(P(t)\) is the investmentâ€™s value after \(t\) years, we have \(P(t)=P_{0}e^{{0.02} t} \text{.}\) We want to find \(t\) such that \(P(t)\) is three times its initial value, \(P_0 \text{.}\)  Therefore, we need to solve:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\newcommand{\amp}{\amp }\begin{aligned}
P(t) \amp = {3} P_0 \\
P_{0}e^{{0.02} t} \amp = {3} P_0 \\
e^{{0.02} t} \amp = {3}  \\
\ln e^{{0.02} t} \amp = \ln {3}  \\
{0.02} t \amp = \ln {3}  \\
t \amp = (\ln {3} )/{0.02} \approx {54.931} \hbox{ years.} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>With continuous compounding, the investment should triple in about \(54.9\) years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the interest is compounded only once a year, the formula we will use is \(P(t)=P_0b^t\) where \(b\) is the percent value of what the investment had been one year earlier.  If it is earning \({2}\%\) interest compounded once a year, it is \(10{2}\%\) of what it had been the previous year, so our formula is \(P(t)=P_{0}({1.02})^{t}.\)</p>
<p>Using this new formula, we will now solve</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\newcommand{\amp}{\amp }\begin{aligned}
P(t) \amp = {3} P_0 \\
P_0({1.02})^{t} \amp = {3} P_{0}  \\
({1.02})^{t} \amp = {3}   \\
\log ({1.02})^t \amp = \log {3}  \\
t \log {1.02} \amp = \log {3}  \\
t \amp = \frac{\log {3} }{\log {1.02}}\approx {55.478} \hbox{ years.} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So, compounding once a year, it will take about \(55.5\) years for the investment to triple.</p>
